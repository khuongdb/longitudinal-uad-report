\section{UAD with Longitudinal VAE}

- Rithy internship results. 

Error threshold:

- image: reconstruction error of the whole image.

- pixel difference $| X_{i,j} - \hat{x}_{i, j} |$: for each pixel compare to the threshold of 95th percentile. 

- pixel\_all difference: $| x_{i, j} - \hat{x}_{i, j} |$ for each image of the training set, FOR EACH position select the 95th percentile as the threshold for each position. 

- Questions: What is the combination of VAE and LVAE in residual error image. 

\section{Lyon team}

- Disease Course Mapping. 

- Save only validation loss for each epoch. 

- Train VAE independently, and then train the Longitudinal statistical model.
